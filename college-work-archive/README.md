## Sections of Note

- [The research paper I produced in Unit 6](Unit-6-Managing-a-Project/Research%20Report.pdf)
- [The project referenced in Unit 4](https://github.com/summerysaturn/FaceFillers-Electron)

Unfortunately, it seems the project in Unit 1 is lost to time. Switching to Ubuntu during the course also made using Visual Studio (not code) projects impossible. It's only a sorting algorithm implementation though, nothing major.
